This is a program I wrote for myself to rename image and video files to add a prefix to the filename based on the date the image was taken.

It turns out that guessing reasonably correctly when an image was taken is really, really hard.

Issues:

I would love it if other people got any use out of this, but I don't expect it, which is why it's got some cleanliness issues.  If you want to use it, please email me at robinleepowell at gmail and I'll fix it, it's not a lot of work.

In particular, the prefix format is fixed and the home timezone of America/Los_Angeles is fixed.
